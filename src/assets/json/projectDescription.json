Faced with the disparity between Macintosh and Windows computers in the agency, where the server presented links with divergent folder separators (backslash for Mac and forward slash for Windows), a I developed a solution for a better work flow and collaboration. The heart of Converter Link lies in a simple yet effective script designed to replace forward slashes with backslashes, ensuring uniformity in link representation across different operating systems. This script, complemented by an intuitive web interface, provided agency teams with a user-friendly tool to effortlessly convert links and mitigate compatibility issues arising from the platform differences.",
